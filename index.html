                <h1 class="title">Excessive Smartphone Use Is Associated With Health Problems in Adolescents and Young Adults - Thoughts and Opinions</h1>

                <p>This article is very fascinating because when people view phones, they consider how practical and convenient they are. This article demonstrates the negative aspects of phones and how they can damage young adults’ minds. This page lists several issues, including depression, detrimental impacts on education, OCD, ADHD, and overuse of alcohol. According to other passages in this article, those who use their phones for extended periods of time during the day experience additional drawbacks like poor sleep and worse assessments of well-being. I have spent a lot of time on my phone in the past years and haven’t experienced any of the issues mentioned in this article. Although I believe this article was really well written and had a lot of excellent material supported by facts. I believe that if phones didn’t exist, life would be much harder, and society would advance much more slowly. Overall, I thought reading this article was entertaining, and I would recommend this article to others.</p>
