            <p>This article is very fascinating because when people view phones, they consider how practical and convenient they are. This article demonstrates the negative aspects of phones and how they can damage young adults’ minds. This page lists several issues, including depression, detrimental impacts on education, OCD, ADHD, and overuse of alcohol. According to other passages in this article, those who use their phones for extended periods of time during the day experience additional drawbacks like poor sleep and worse assessments of well-being. I have spent a lot of time on my phone in the past years and haven’t experienced any of the issues mentioned in this article. Although I believe this article was really well written and had a lot of excellent material supported by facts. I believe that if phones didn’t exist, life would be much harder, and society would advance much more slowly. Overall, I thought reading this article was entertaining, and I would recommend this article to others.</p>

            <p class="p2">This well-written article explains how Bulgarian researchers discovered wormholes. There was a part in this article that explained what would happen if you were to fly into a wormhole, which would allow you to traverse far distances quickly. Wormholes and blackholes are difficult to distinguish from one another and operate in distinct ways. You need to examine the data from sophisticated telescopes and sensors to locate wormholes. The radiation intensity is used to quantify the data. Finding certain light manipulations is the latest technique for searching for wormholes. This article claims that finding wormholes is “like looking for a needle in a haystack,” which is quite intriguing to me. I learned more about wormholes after reading this article, which has a lot of useful information for individuals interested in space and wormholes. </p>
